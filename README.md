# hypergeometric
R code script for performing the hypergeometric test and BH FDR correction (Bunnik et al., Genome Biology, 2016)

This script performs a hypergeometric test on each row of a dataframe with 4 columns. The list of raw p-values is then adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction.
